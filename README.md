This is a starting point for Java solutions to the
["Build Your Own Shell" Challenge](https://app.codecrafters.io/courses/shell/overview).

1. Ensure you have `mvn` installed locally
1. Run `./your_program.sh` to run your program, which is implemented in
   `src/main/java/Main.java`.
1. Commit your changes and run `git push origin master` to submit your solution
   to CodeCrafters. Test output will be streamed to your terminal.
